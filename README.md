# part-inventory
This C++ program operates with a file containing information about parts. Typing in a part number that exists in the file will display a report detailing the part's stock, class, cost, and inventory value. Typing in a part number that is not in the file will allow the user to insert the part number into the list in the correct spot regarding alphabetical and numerical order. The program will keep asking the user for more part numbers until the user indicates that more input is not necessary; the program will then display a report detailing the number of successful searches and new part numbers, and the program will rewrite the file to save any changes made.
